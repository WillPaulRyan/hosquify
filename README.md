# Hosquify

A Spotify-inspired music client, using Apple's [iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/)

## Getting Started

Navigate to the project's root directory and run `docker-compose up -d` to run the program on your machine. Hosquify will deploy on `localhost` or `192.168.99.100`, depending on your Docker configuration,

Alternatively, the program can be run with npm by using `npm run start` in the project root directory.

### Prerequisites

Docker and docker-compose are required to deploy Hosquify on Docker, or nodejs and npm to run the code on your own. 

### Installing

`git pull` the repository, then run `docker-compose up -d` in the project's root directory, and you'll be up and running.
